# Richochet Robots Web Impl

A fun project I made because I didn't like this or that aspect of other web versions of RR out there.

## Set-up

To run the server
0. clone the repo
1. install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/, I'm using v16.14.2)
2. Run `npm update` in the repo to get the required packages
3. `node server.js` (the default port is currently 8080)

To use the optional C++ solver
4. Run `npm run compile` 

Then you can point your local browser to `127.0.0.1:8080`.

To run it online, right now I'm just running it through an http tunnel.
